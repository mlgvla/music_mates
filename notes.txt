- add placeholders to edit boxes
- populate checkboxes with user_instrument values on edit form
- change visibility data type to string
- remove levels attribute from user_instrument table if not implemented in this version
- hard code situation where no checkboxes are checked
    if user[user_instrument_ids][] is empty, then delete all entries from user_instrument table for that user.

- consider level a stretch feature for next version

- insert authentication_required call before user routes to generate flash notices



SAMPLE SEARCHES 

Finding Users by Instrument:
Example:
    - User.joins(:user_instruments).where(user_instruments: {instrument_id: 2})

Assigning a level to a UserInstrument
    - Must use ActiveRecord Extensions to do it semantically.

    - otherwise, must retrieve user and instrument ids and retrieve a UserInstrument Object explicitly, then assign level to level attribute

Update a level to a UserInstrument

    - UserInstrument.all[2].update(level: "Professional") or as in first example

Finding players by level

    - UserInstrument.where(level: "Professional") or as in first example

Finding players by instument and level

    - UserInstrument.where("instrument_id = ? AND level = ?", 2, "Professional") or as in first example
